# TODO: On-Prem Era Story (Chapters + Flow)

## Goal
Document how traditional on-prem infrastructure worked before cloud adoption.

## What to cover
- Typical on-prem architecture (data center, racks, networking, storage)
- Procurement and provisioning timelines
- Operations flow (ticketing, change windows, maintenance)
- Real-world examples and diagrams
- Pain points that motivated change

## Deliverable
A chapter-style narrative with at least one diagram and a short case study.
