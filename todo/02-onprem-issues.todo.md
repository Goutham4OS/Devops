# TODO: Why On-Prem Had Issues

## Goal
Explain why on-prem models struggled at scale and drove the shift to newer architectures.

## What to cover
- Scaling limits and capacity planning
- Long lead times and hardware constraints
- Reliability challenges and DR complexity
- Cost visibility and underutilization
- Security/compliance and patching overhead

## Deliverable
A concise analysis with a comparison table: on-prem vs cloud.
